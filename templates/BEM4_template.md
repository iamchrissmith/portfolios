# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

Increase my proficiency in JavaScript on both the Frontend and Backend.

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Small snags moving from Rails to Express APIs such as configuring CORS, how `knex.raw` is slightly different than `activerecord`

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
Applied the necessary Express changes or slightly altered the Frontend to adapt it.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Writing OOP JavaScript and getting to write a backend in Node/Express

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

* Organizing JS into classes
* Express Model/Controller organization
* I decided to increase the challenge of the project by using FlowType on the Frontend pieces I worked on.  This lead me in the direction of a more strongly/explicitly typed JavaScript.

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
Not using jQuery to update/build the entire DOM. For an app that was even a little more full featured than this, it would get too callback-y too quickly.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
Both Bao and I were pretty comfortable with JavaScript before this project, so it did not present any special challenges.  

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
